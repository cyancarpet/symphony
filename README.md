# symphony
The symphony between us: an interactive musical network-graph tool


## to begin
`npm install`

## running locally
`npm start`

then open `localhost:3000`

## running in watch mode (for developing)
`npm run dev` (will open two processes, one watching for server.js changes and the other watching for changes in src/index.js)

then open `localhost:3000`

## where to edit things
`server.js` serves our app, api, and static files
`src/index.js` holds our frontend javascript

`public/index.html` and `public/style.css` are markup and styles, respectively


`public/main.js` is a generated bundle from src/index.js (don't edit this)
